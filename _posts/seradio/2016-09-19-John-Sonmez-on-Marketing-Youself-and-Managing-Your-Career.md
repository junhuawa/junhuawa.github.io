### Career management 

The biggest thing I would say is just *having a goal*. knowing where you're going. 
Analogy to a ship sailing in the ocean without a destination. you gonna flow, you gonna go some where. 
But who knows where you gonna go? But when you have a goal, a destination, you can sail in a particular direction, 
and turn the retta in order to go that direction. more likely you can use the wind to take you there. 
Many developer assume that in 5 years, they will be in better place. But they don't have a target. 
They don't have solid goals. If you set a goal, especially write it down on the paper, 
put it some where you will see it every single day, then the chance of achieving that goal go up tremendously. 
Setting goals, achieving them in a 2 year period, I achieve things more than I had in previous 10 years. 

*Start with the end in mind*

### What will the future workforce look like?

To an entrepreneurs type of system. contract services. you can hire really good developers outside of 3rd world countries. 
The workforce of majority were entrepreneurs, who are building their own businesses, 
who are working as freelancers, providing services, not just hourly.
2000 $ to building a website. 

You have to have a reputation, have a brand. if you want to get the business. 
Long term guarantee jobs are belong to our father, and grand father's age. 

### Specialization

T shape model, a broad base, and a narrow  specialization, 
If you're a specialist, you have chance to be a big fish in a small pond. 
It's much better than a big fish in a big pond. 

People are going to pay more for specialist. Android list view guru, C++ pointer guru. 
You can build a reputation, people will know who you're because of that very narrow specialty. 
Go to speak in conference, submit paper on that, have deep knowledge in one specific area to start with. pay a lot more. 

### How to "hack" the interview

You build the relationship with the company, the interviewer ahead of the time. personal referral to get in the door. 
We are proud we are rational beings, but we are emotional, the core of who we are. Fool by randomness. We really hire people we like. 
    
What we do is make all kinds of justifications why they technically competent, why they are the best candidates, 
when we pick the person we like. 

If you do have skills, the best way, interview is not the best to determine who is the most qualified person. 
In 1 hour, you not gonna figure out who is the most qualified person. 1 hour you might figure out who you like. 

How can you in a smart way get personal referral. If you don't know someone in that company, 
maybe you meet someone in the company, start to go to user group they go to. 
Connect to linkedin, and ask buy a cup of coffee. Figure out ways to make some relationship, or follow someone's blog. comment their blogs. 

You network 6 months before you look for a job. 
You network when you need something, that's not called networking, that's called using people. 
People know it. you build the relationship ahead of the time. *Giving them values first, and then ask.* 

### Marketing

Connecting someone who needs a product, or service with that product or service. 
You provide code, or write code, without marketing, no one will know people need something, and people have something. 
People should respect my ability and my code. They would love to do it, but don't know you are the great coder. 
Because there is no evidence, because you haven't done any marketing. *没有一个创业公司，不打广告，而客户会自动找上门。* 

**Marketing means Giving people values, helping people.**
