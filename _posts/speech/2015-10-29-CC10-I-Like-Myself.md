I like myself!
-----
Let me ask you all a question? Who is the most important person in your life? Do you like yourself?

When I was in school, I hate myself very much! But when I was a small boy, I didn’t hate myself. My attitude changed because of one event.  When I was in junior school, 
I was the tallest guy in my class, but I was not very strong! One day, on the playground, because of some reason, I fought with a classmate, 
and he was like 马云，very small, and short.  I believed I can beat him to death, and he will cry for help! I was full of confidence to beat him. 
And when I got off from school, and went back to home with proud. I felt my hand was injured very much! Because I put forth my strength too much when I beat him, 
my wrist was injured very much. And it began to swell, the next day, my wrist was swelled like a bread, I had to go to the hospital to see the doctor. 
And I can't use my hand to write anymore! It's really a disaster!

Before the event, I believed I'm strong,  and can beat my classmates to death, but after that fight, I hurt myself, sent to hospital, but my classmate was OK. 
I lost my confidence. I know although I was very tall, but I don't have strength!

Until one day, I met a teacher in the college. The course he taught was named how to success. He was very energetic and powerful. And I was moved by his speech, 
his course very much! From then on, I began to change myself. Everyday morning, I began to say energetic words to myself: I like myself, I love myself! I create myself! 
Every night, I dream I can speak in front of many many people.

One time, our teacher gave us a very tough task, to give a speech on the bus. It's really an interesting journey. 
3 classmates with me went to a bus, we stood on the front of the bus and began our speech one by one. Most of us began our speech like this: Hello, every one, 
I'm a college student, and I want to give a speech in the bus, first, let me introduce myself, brabra, let me introduce my hometown, brabra, welcome to my hometown!.  
At the beginning, the passengers don't know what's happening, and after one speech, they know it's a speech given by college students, they give us a big applauds. 
It's really an interesting and crazy journey.

Later, because of the interesting experience, I decided to give a speech on the bus by myself. I remember that day in November, near to the Christmas eve, 
I went to a bus, the bus was crowded, many people stood on the bus. I stood at the front of the bus, and began my speech. My speech was about the Christmas festival, 
I talked about the fairy tales related to Santa Claus. Finally, I said: my speech is end, thanks! I was waiting for applauds, but, there was no applauds, 
no exciting moment. Many passengers near me watched at me, it was like I was a mouse in the street. And other passengers were talking with each other loudly.  
I got off the bus in next station, and was totally embarrassed. I lost my confidence again! I know It was a failure.

After I graduated from college and went to work, I met toastmaster club. Toastmaster is also an energetic place, and I was encouraged to finish my first CC1 to CC6 
speech in first half year. But then, I began to slow down my speed. I finished my CC9 speech in the beginning of last year, after 20 months, 
I start to give my CC10 speech. My CC10 speech is an evidence of my serious procrastination, and I felt the failure again.

All in all, I find I want to change myself, but I don't have enough confidence sometimes. For example, during the table topic session, 
when the master ask us to the stage, I always have very complex feeling. I want to try but afraid the failure, afraid people will laugh at me. 
Although many people encourage me to give speech, and I also have encouraged others to give speech, But I still have fears every time. 
I'm very 纠结 before I give my speech. So, I know I'm not a perfect man like our  ex-president Ni Peter.

I have joined the toastmaster club many years. This is my CC10 speech, the last speech for the CC project. 
Recall my experience, my journey in the toastmaster, I found in the toastmaster, I have met many great toastmasters,  great 小伙伴。 
But I still have regrets in toastmaster. I found I never can give speech like our president, like some great people. 
They can give speech in a natural way, but I can't.

Also I have learned many things from toastmaster, I think the most important is that I found I can't give speeches as well as our president, 
our president will never 纠结，but I will.

I  纠结in the past，before I join the toastmaster, I 纠结 now, I believe I will 纠结 in the future.  
But I will not give myself too high expectations, I will not strive for perfection. 
I accept failure in my life, because I'm not perfect! I like myself! I accept myself!

Finally, I would end my speech with a Chinese poem:  

我喜欢我！一个不完美的我！因为不完美，那才是我！完美的我不是我，那只是一尊雕塑！
