### Please respect our baby’s fundamental human rights!

Many years ago, when I was in high school, I had a very good friend. He was short, but we played very well. One day, my parents knew I played with him. They were very angry, my parents shouted to me:
“You are so tall, he is so short. You play with him, it’s like an adult play with a baby. It’s a shame! Do not play with him!” From then on, I lost my friend. I felt   very sad, I hate my height. If I was not so tall, I could play with my friend! And I swear, if I had a baby, no matter he is tall or short, 
I would give him true freedom!  

Dear guests, dear toastmaster, dear contest chair, Good afternoon!

In the year 2011,  my son was born.  After his birth, my parents came to Hangzhou to take care of him. My parents are farmer.  they have little knowledge of how to care a baby. So, they use a simple and traditional way to care my son. Let me give you some examples:	

Firstly, my parents consider my son as a treasure, they want to give him the best care in the world,  but they don’t want him to take any risk. Any risky actions are forbidden:

My son wants to play water. No, it’s dangerous!

My son wants to go to the kitchen. No, it’s noisy and not safe. 

My son wants to play on the ground. No, it’s dirty! You can’t do that!

Every time my son wants to do something they don’t like. The answer is “No! You can’t do that!”.

Because my son has heard so many “NO”s,   the first sentence he ever learnt to say is: No, it’s dangerous!

Secondly, my parents like to feed my son very much. Although my son is almost 3 years old, they still use spoon to feed him. Because of that, my son doesn’t have the ability to take food by himself. In my parents’ mind, they want to feed my son until he is 7 years old. It’s terrible! 
Have you seen some parents running behind, trying to catch their baby, in order to feed him food. 

Son, eat a bite, … , Calm down, son, come, eat a bite, Son, son, don’t run around, be quiet! Please, please just take one more bite, take this one, you can watch the Cartoon, ok?
That was my parents. It’s terrible!

My parents love my son very much, but the way they take care of him is totally wrong. 
Our baby is also a man, they are not toys or pets. A man has many fundamental human rights! Maybe you haven’t noticed, taking food by yourself is also a fundamental human right! The criminals in prison lost their freedom, their rights, but they still have the right to take food by themselves! If a baby already has the ability to take food by himself, you still feed him! Don’t you think it’s a more serious crime?!

Exploring the world is also a fundamental human right!  To our baby, it’s a brand new world. He is curious about everything, he want to play water because he is curious about the water; He want to play on the ground because he is curious about the ground; He want to go to the kitchen because he is curious about the noise and smell from the kitchen when we do cooking. It’s where his happiness and knowledge are come from. All we can do is protecting them from the real danger, not stop them from exploring the world! 

Our babies have many fundamental human rights. For example: Wear clothes by themselves, make friends by themselves, read books they like but you don’t like, play sands, etc. All of them need our respect and protection. So, 

I have a dream, that one day, our babies can enjoy taking food by themselves, and their grandparents will not disturb them;

I have a dream, that one day, our babies can enjoy exploring the world, and their grandparents will say: “Son, go ahead!”

I have a dream, that one day, our babies can enjoy the fundamental human rights!

语速放慢，带感情去做speech；
动作夸张一点，因为你是在做speech；
主要目的是超越自己，把自己想表达的东西表达出来，感染别人！
