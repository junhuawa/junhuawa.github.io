### FIFO and Round Robin

Both are used to schedule Realtime tasks. 

**FIFO** means it will run forever if occupy the CPU, unless higher priority task
come or it exit by itself.  If there are >1 real time tasks with same
priority, the 2nd task will run until the 1st task drop the CPU by itself.

**Round Robin** means run the real time tasks one by one periodically.
Allocate time slice for 1st task, after it consume the slice, it will be
appended to the ready queue rear, then allocate slice for 2nd task...

    SCHED_OTHER
    SCHED_FIFO
    SCHED_RR

### SCHED_OTHER
In this mode, kernel use CFS scheduler (Complete Fair Scheduler).
