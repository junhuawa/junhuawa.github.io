Inside RT Patch

#### What's your advice for developers who want to get involved?

Find something you want to work on and do it. One thing I've learned while working on the -rt patch is that you can not push things into the kernel. They need to be pulled in. Don't come around saying that you have the best new feature and everyone should just throw flower petals at your heels. You need to convince the current maintainers that what you have will benefit them. If you can achieve this, you will start having people asking you for code. You need to start with helping others and the community, and this does not mean just fixing whitespace and typos. If you can give a performance benefit, or just clean up the code by making it easier to maintain and understand without sacrificing performance, you will do the community a great service.
