#### Meaning of do_div( , ) 

I found from mddg_sfn.c, there is a function which used to get the seconds of
bcn delta. 

    do_div(bcn_delta_sec, 100); // delta in full seconds

The function definition can be found from linux-3.10/arch/arm/include/asm/div64.h.

```c
    /*
    * The semantics of do_div() are:
    *
    * uint32_t do_div(uint64_t *n, uint32_t base)
    * {
    * 	uint32_t remainder = *n % base;
    * 	*n = *n / base;
    * 	return remainder;
    * }
    *
    * In other words, a 64-bit dividend with a 32-bit divisor producing
    * a 64-bit result and a 32-bit remainder.  To accomplish this optimally
    * we call a special __do_div64 helper with completely non standard
    * calling convention for arguments and results (beware).
