you can use an inline formula $$\forall x \in R$$ like this one

$$
M = \left( \begin{array}{ccc}
x_{11} & x_{12} & \ldots \\
x_{21} & x_{22} & \ldots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \ldots \\
\end{array} \right)
$$

1. Surround your math ccontent with 2 dollar signs, end with 2 dollar signs.

2. The pipe symbol | in inline math statements may lead to a line being
   recognized as a table line. This problem can be avoided by using the \vert
   command instead of |!

3. If there is text in the math content, need use \hbox*{embeded text}*.
