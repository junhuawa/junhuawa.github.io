\section*{Section Headings}

We explain in this section how to obtain headings
for the various \textit{sections} and \textbf{subsections} of our
document.

\subsection*{Headings in the ‘article’ Document Style}
In the ‘article’ style, the document may be divided up
into sections, subsections and subsubsections, and each
can be \textbf{given a title}, printed in a boldface font,
simply by issuing the appropriate command.
