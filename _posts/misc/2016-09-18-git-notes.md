### Git push need username, password, how to avoid?

Solution 1:

A common mistake is cloning using the default (HTTPS) instead of SSH. You can correct this by going to your repository, 
clicking the ssh button left to the URL field and updating the URL of your origin remote like this:

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:username/repo.git


Solution 2: 

git push https://username:password@myrepository.biz/file.git --all

in this case https://username:password@myrepository.biz/file.git replace the origin in git push origin --all

To see more options for git push, try git help push

**Attention:**

    In our company, use ssh URL instead of HTTPS URL does't work because the port of ssh have been disable by company's firewall.

### To see your repo URL, run:

git remote show origin


### My Logs

git remote set-url origin git@github.com:junhuawa/junhuawa.github.io.git

[junhuawa@Tesla junhuawa.github.io]$ git remote set-url origin https://github.com/junhuawa/

junhuawa.github.io.git

[junhuawa@Tesla junhuawa.github.io]$ git remote show origin

    * remote origin
      Fetch URL: https://github.com/junhuawa/junhuawa.github.io.git
      Push  URL: https://github.com/junhuawa/junhuawa.github.io.git
      HEAD branch: master
      Remote branch:
        master tracked
      Local branch configured for 'git pull':
        master merges with remote master
      Local ref configured for 'git push':
        master pushes to master (fast-forwardable)
