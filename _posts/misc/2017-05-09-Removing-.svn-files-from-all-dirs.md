### Removing .svn files from all directories

You can do a thing called an SVN Export to get the files without the .svn directories.

    svn export — Export a clean directory tree.

Export from your working copy (doesn't print every file and directory), it means your local copy:

    $ svn export a-wc my-export
    Export complete.

Export directly from the repository (prints every file and directory), it means from server link:

    $ svn export file:///var/svn/repos my-export
    A    my-export/test
    A    my-export/quiz
    ...
    Exported revision 15.
