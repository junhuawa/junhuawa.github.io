    :g/^$/d //(empty line with no characters)
    :g/^\s*$/d //(empty line include tab, space), Here, \s* means zero or more white space characters.
command line:
    echo "wq"|ex -c "g/^$/d" *filename*

### 

vim -b
Edit in binary mode. This is self-explanatory and very cool. Editing binary files is an acquired taste,
but this is a powerful way to edit files not touchable by most other tools. Users should read Vim's help
section on editing binary files.

vim -d
Start in diff mode. Vim uses the OS-available diff command, which is diff on Unix systems.

vim -o
Open all files in a separate window.
-O
Like -o, but opens vertically split windows
