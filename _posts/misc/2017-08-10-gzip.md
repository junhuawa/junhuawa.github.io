#### gzip: MYFILE.zip: unknown suffix — ignored

当我用gunzip解压一个zip包, 比如MYFILE.zip时报错,
原因是gzip/gunzip期望文件后缀是.gz的.

gzip is file compressor/decompressor for files that generally have the file
extension .gz and cannot extract files from a file like colorbox.zip. On linux
you would use zip and unzip to add and extract files in a zip file.
